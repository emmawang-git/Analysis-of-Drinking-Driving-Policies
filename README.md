# Analysis-of-Drinking-Driving-Policies
This is an R project of car crashes and drinking driving regulations in New Zealand. 

## Description
Drinking driving is a long-standing controvercial topic aroudn the world. For road safety, the Cabinet reduced the blood alcohol limit in 2011/2014.  
* After Aug 2011, there was zero alcohol tolerance for those under 20 yrs old;  
* After Dec 2014, the new limits for those over 20 were 250 mcg/L in breathe test and 50 mg/100ml in blood test. 

The goal of this project was to analyze whether the reductions in alcohol limits were effective in reducing the counts of accidents and/or alleviating the severity of the crashes.
